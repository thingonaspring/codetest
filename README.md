Created a bonus game from scratch with some basic assets, based on design and description provided.

Setup project using Boilerplate HTML5 template in Webstorm for time + ease of use.
Using PixiJS and Gsap tween libraries for rendering and animation.
Using JS-Signals lib - also for time + ease of use rather than implementing full on notifications/events.

Modules would be proper modules with views, mediators, models, managers etc
Cheats = value per relevant segment on wheel,
Random = random with no weighting.
Weight = random with weighting.

TODO
